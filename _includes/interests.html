			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Extra Computing Interests</b>. If you have another area in computing you are interested in, add it here.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>RC Planes and Boats</b>. I've been an enthusiastic hobbiest since I was a teenager - I like to modify existing kits to improve speed, and add instrumentation.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Mountaineering</b>. I live in the Pacific Northwest, home of some of the greatest mountains and trails in the country. I enjoy spending weekends
          on scrambles and getting lost in the woods.

          OpenGidget is an open-source fork of Raspbian Linux that makes it easier to auto-provision a headless Raspberry PI,
          get it onto your WiFi network, and deploy simple Python and Ruby scripts that run at startup - all without needing to plug in a keyboard/monitor.
